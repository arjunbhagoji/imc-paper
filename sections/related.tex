Mirsky et al. \cite{mirsky_lightweight_2020} consider the use of an Extended Markov Model (EMM) to model anomalies across IoT devices and a blockchain for the secure aggregation of the locally trained models. Each model is just a transition matrix for the probabilities of transition from one location to another in the device, so low probability transitions are flagged as anomalous. Aggregation is done by simply adding up the local transition matrices.
